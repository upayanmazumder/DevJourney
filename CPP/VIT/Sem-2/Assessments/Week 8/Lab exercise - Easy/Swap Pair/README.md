Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Madhu is designing a program to handle various types of pairs, where each pair consists of a float value and a double value. You need to implement a class template called Pair that can store and swap the float and double values within the pair. The program should take user input for a float value and a double value and then use the Pair class template to swap the values and display the pair before and after the swap.



Implement a template class called Pair that stores two members of any data type. The class should have a constructor to initialize the data members and a function swap to swap the values of the data members.



Take user input to initialize the data members and output the values before and after the swap operation.

Input format :
The first line contains a single float value.

The second line contains a single double value.

Output format :
The output displays the following format:

The "Values before swap" section displays the original float and double values.

The "Values after swap" section displays the float and double values after swapping the Celsius and Fahrenheit values.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The float value a should be within the range -1.0e9 to 1.0e9.

The double value b should be within the range -1.0e18 to 1.0e18.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
45.43
96.25
Output 1 :
Values before swap: 
First: 45.43
Second: 96.25
Values after swap: 
First: 96.25
Second: 45.43
Input 2 :
968.32
478.25
Output 2 :
Values before swap: 
First: 968.32
Second: 478.25
Values after swap: 
First: 478.25
Second: 968.32
