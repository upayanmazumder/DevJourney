Single File Programming Question
Problem statement



Mandy wants to calculate the factorial of a number and the sum of its digits. Help her with a program for the same using a call-by-reference function.



Write a program that takes an integer as input and computes both the factorial and the sum of its digits.

Input format :
The input consists of an integer N representing the number for Mandy's calculations.

Output format :
The first line prints "Factorial: " followed by an integer which is the factorial of the given number N.

The second line prints "Sum of digits of the factorial: " followed by an integer which is the sum of the digits of the factorial.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
Output 1 :
Factorial: 120
Sum of digits of the factorial: 3
Input 2 :
9
Output 2 :
Factorial: 362880
Sum of digits of the factorial: 27
