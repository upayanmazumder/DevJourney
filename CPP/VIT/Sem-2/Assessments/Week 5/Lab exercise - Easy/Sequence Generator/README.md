Problem Statement



Create a class A that takes an integer N as input and generates a sequence of N numbers where each number alternates between 1 and 6. The program should start with 1 and then repeatedly switch from 1 and 6 for N iterations, displaying each number in the sequence separated by a space.



Use class and objects to solve the program.

Input format :
The input consists of an integer N.

Output format :
The output displays N space-separated integers, representing the generated sequence of numbers.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 20
