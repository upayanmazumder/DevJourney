# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Bhuvi is studying geometry, and she wants to determine the type of a triangle based on its side lengths. She needs your help to write a program using a class Triangle that can classify triangles as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

Equilateral triangle - All sides are equal

Isosceles triangle - Any two sides are equal

Scalene triangle - All sides are different

### Input format :

The input consists of three space-separated integers: a, b, and c representing the lengths of the sides.

### Output format :

The output prints one of the following:

"Equilateral triangle" - if all sides are equal.

"Isosceles triangle" - if any two sides are equal.

"Scalene triangle" - if all sides are different.

### Code constraints :

1 \<= a, b, c \<= 1000

### Sample test cases :

#### Input 1 :

3 4 8

#### Output 1 :

Scalene triangle

#### Input 2 :

7 7 7

#### Output 2 :

Equilateral triangle

#### Input 3 :

10 10 13

#### Output 3 :

Isosceles triangle
