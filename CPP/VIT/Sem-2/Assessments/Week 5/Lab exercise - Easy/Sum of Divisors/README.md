# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Taylor wants a program to calculate the sum of all divisors of a given integer. The program should take an integer N as input and, using call by reference, compute and display the sum of divisors.

Assist Taylor in implementing the program using a call-by-reference function.

### Input format :

The input consists of an integer N, for which the sum of all divisors needs to be calculated.

### Output format :

The output displays an integer which is the sum of all divisors of N.

Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

### Code constraints :

In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 1000

### Sample test cases :

#### Input 1 :

20

#### Output 1 :

42

#### Input 2 :

17

#### Output 2 :

18
