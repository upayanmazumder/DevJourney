# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with developing a program for a Math competition. One of the challenges in the competition requires participants to find the sum of the squares of the first n even numbers and odd numbers.

Write a C++ program that uses an inline function to calculate the sum of the squares of the first n even and odd numbers. The program should take an input value of n from the user and output the result. You need to implement the necessary functions and ensure that the program handles the computation accurately.

Function specifications:

inline int sumOfSquaresEven - calculates the sum of squares of the first n even numbers

inline int sumOfSquaresOdd - calculates the sum of squares of the first n odd numbers

Note: This is a sample question asked in Accenture recruitment.

### Input format :

The input consists of a positive integer N.

### Output format :

The first line of output displays the sum of squares of the first N even numbers.

The second line of output displays the sum of squares of the first N odd numbers.

### Code constraints :

1 \<= N \<= 30

### Sample test cases :

#### Input 1 :

3

#### Output 1 :

56
35
Whitelist
Set 1:
inline int sumOfSquaresEven
inline int sumOfSquaresOdd
