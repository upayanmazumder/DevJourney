Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers and then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers using an inline function. The GCD can be calculated using Euclid's algorithm.

Input format :
The input consists of two integers separated by space.

Output format :
The output displays the GCD of the two integers.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ integers ≤ 109

Input 2 :
12 18
Output 2 :
GCD of 12 and 18 is 6
Input 3 :
255 999
Output 3 :
GCD of 255 and 999 is 3
