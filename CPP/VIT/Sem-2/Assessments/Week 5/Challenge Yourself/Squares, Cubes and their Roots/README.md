# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Write a program to find the square, square root, cube, and cube root of the given number.

Create a class Demo and include a constructor to initialize the value and write a method display to print square, square root, cube, and cube root of the given number after that the destructor destroys the object.

### Input format :

The input consists of a single integer n.

### Output format :

The output prints the result.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

### Code constraints :

The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 100

### Sample test cases :

#### Input 1 :

15

#### Output 1 :

Inside Constructor
square = 225
square root = 3.87298
cube = 3375
cube root = 2.46621
Inside Destructor

#### Input 2 :

9

#### Output 2 :

Inside Constructor
square = 81
square root = 3
cube = 729
cube root = 2.08008
Inside Destructor
