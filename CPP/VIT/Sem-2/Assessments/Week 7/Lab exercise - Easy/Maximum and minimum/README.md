Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Vamsi is a young and curious student who is eager to learn about finding the minimum number among a set of integers and double values. He needs a program to find the minimum number from a given set of values.



Help him solve the program by overloading the function named findMin.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of three space-separated integers.

The second line consists of three space-separated double values.

Output format :
The first line of output prints "Minimum integer: " followed by the minimum integer among the given values.

The second line prints "Minimum double-point value: " followed by the minimum double-point number among the given values, rounded off to two decimal places.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ integers ≤ 1000

0.00 ≤ double-point values ≤ 1000.00

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
8 3 7
19.4 10.5 0.8
Output 1 :
Minimum integer: 3
Minimum double-point value: 0.80
Input 2 :
435 768 346
3.531 4.561 7.89
Output 2 :
Minimum integer: 346
Minimum double-point value: 3.53
