# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Create a class Parent that has a method "add" which prints the addition of two integers.

Create a class child1 that is a child class of the Parent class. It has a method "sub" that prints the subtraction of two integers.

Create a class child2 that is a child class of the Parent class. It has a method "mul" that prints the multiplication of two integers.

Create a class child3 that is a child class of the Parent class. It has a method "div" that prints the division of two integers.

Create an object of the child3 class. Then, from this object, call the four methods add, sub, mul, and div inherited from the child1 class and display the results.

### Input format :
