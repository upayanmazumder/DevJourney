Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Stiles is teaching about the concept of circumference through Hierarchical Inheritance. 



He has created a base class called Circle that contains radius as an attribute. From this base class, he has derived two classes: Class1 and Class2. Each of these derived classes has a method to calculate the circumference of a circle. 



Help him write the program and display the calculated circumferences using two classes.



Formulas

Circumference using class 1 = 2 * 3.14159 * radius
Circumference using class 2 = 23.14 * radius


Refer to the below class diagram:



﻿

Input format :
The input consists of a double value, representing the radius of the circle.

Output format :
The first line of output prints "Class 1: X" where X is a double value, rounded off to two decimal places.

The second line prints "Class 2: Y" where Y is a double value, rounded off to two decimal places.



Refer to the sample outputs for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
0.01 ≤ radius ≤ 100.00

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5.15
Output 1 :
Class 1: 32.36
Class 2: 119.17
Input 2 :
10.5
Output 2 :
Class 1: 65.97
Class 2: 242.97
Input 3 :
3.14159
Output 3 :
Class 1: 19.74
Class 2: 72.70
