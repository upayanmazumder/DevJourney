# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Design a program to calculate the sum of the first N odd or even numbers based on the provided type.

Implement a class Calculator with constructors for different scenarios: one to initialize N and type, one to adjust the starting point if necessary, and a function calculateSum() to calculate the sum.

The program should take input for the type ("odd" or "even") and the value of N and output the sum of the first N numbers of the specified type.

### Input format :

The first line of input consists of a string type, which can be either "odd" or "even".

The second line consists of an integer N, representing the number of odd or even numbers to sum.

### Output format :

The output prints the sum of the first N numbers of the specified type.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

### Code constraints :

1 ≤ N ≤ 15

### Sample test cases :

#### Input 1 :

odd
5

#### Output 1 :

25

#### Input 2 :

even
4

#### Output 2 :

20
