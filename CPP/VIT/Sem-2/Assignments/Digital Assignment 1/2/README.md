Create a class called ‘Room1’ with private data members such as length and breadth.  Use  default  constructor  to  get  user  input  for  length  and  breadth  in metre.  Create another class called ‘Room2’ with private data members such as length and breadth. Use parameterized constructor to assign user input to length and  breadth  in  feet.  Create  a  friend  function  for  the  above  two  classes  to calculate the sum of areas of Room1 and Room2 and display the area in feet (1 m = 3.2808 ft). Write a C++ program to implement the above scenario.
