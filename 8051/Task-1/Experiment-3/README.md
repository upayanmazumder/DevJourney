1. Write a program to transfer a string of data from code space starting at address 200H to RAM locations starting at 40H. The data is as shown below:
0200H: DB “VIT UNIVERSITY”
Using the simulator, single-step through the program and examine the data transfer and registers.
2. Add the following subroutine to the previous program, single-step through the subroutine and examine the RAM locations. After data has been transferred from ROM space into RAM, the subroutine should copy the data from RAM locations starting at 40H to RAM locations starting at 60H.
