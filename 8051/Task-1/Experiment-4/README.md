1. Write a program to add 10 bytes of data and store the result in registers R2 and R3. The bytes are stored in the ROM space starting at 200H. The data would look as follows:
MYDATA: DB 22H, 43H, 23H, 34H, 31H, 77H, 91H, 33H, 43H, 07H
2. Write a program to add 10 bytes of BCD data and store the result in R2 and R3. The bytes are stored in ROM space starting at 200H. The data would look as follows:
MYDATA: DB 22H, 43H, 23H, 34H, 31H, 77H, 91H, 33H, 43H, 07H
