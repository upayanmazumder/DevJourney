Write and assemble a program to load following values (25H, 35H, 45H, 55H & 65H) into each of registers R0–R4 and then push each of these registers onto the stack. Single-step the program, and examine the stack and the SP register after the execution of each instruction.
2. Write an 8051 assembly language program to:
(a) Set SP = 0DH.
(b) Put a different value in each of RAM locations 0DH, 0CH, 0BH, 0AH, 09H, and 08H.
(c) POP each stack location into registers R0–R4. Use the simulator to single-step and examine the registers, the stack, and the stack pointer.
3. Write and assemble a program to load values into each of registers R0–R4 and then push each of these registers onto the stack and pop them back. Single-step the program, and examine the stack and the SP register after the execution of each instruction.
4. Write and assemble a program to add the following data and then use the simulator to examine the CY flag: 92H, 23H, 66H, 87H, F5H.
