Single File Programming Question
Program Statement



James is developing a utility that helps calculate speed based on distance and time. He knows that speed is the distance traveled per unit of time and needs a program from you to facilitate this calculation. 



Program Structure

Main class: This class interacts with the user, takes input for distance and time, and uses the SpeedCalculator class to calculate and display the speed.
SpeedCalculator class: This class contains a constructor that calculates the speed based on the distance and time provided.


Formula:

speed = distance/time

Input format :
The first line of the input consists of a double value representing the distance traveled.﻿

The second line consists of a double value representing the time taken.

Output format :
The output prints "Speed: " followed by a double value representing the speed, rounded off to two decimal places.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1.00 ≤ distance travelled ≤ 250.00

1.0 ≤ time ≤ 30.0

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
50.23
2.4
Output 1 :
Speed: 20.93
Input 2 :
23.25
4.5
Output 2 :
Speed: 5.17
