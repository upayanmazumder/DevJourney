## Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Jordan is examining a sequence of numbers and wants to find those that are greater than the number formed by reversing their digits.

You are given a list of integers by Jordan. Store them in a file named input.txt, with each number on a separate line.

Your task is to identify and extract the numbers that are greater than their reversed form. Save the valid numbers to a file named output.txt on a single line, separated by spaces.

If no numbers meet the condition, write the message "No numbers found" to the output file.

#### Input:

```
format :
```

First line: An integer n — the total number of integers in the list.

Second line: n space-separated integers.

#### Output:

```
format :
```

A single line with space-separated numbers that are greater than their reverse.

If none are found, print: No numbers found

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 30

1 ≤ each integer ≤ 1000
