# Pascal's Triangle

## Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Sophia is curious about patterns in mathematics and discovers Pascal's Triangle during her studies. To explore its structure, she decides to write a program that generates any specific row. She creates a Java class named PascalTriangle to handle the logic of generating a row.

By using the concept of binomial coefficients, she calculates each value in the row accurately. Her program takes an input number n and prints the nth row of Pascal's Triangle. This helps Sophia visualize combinations and enhances her understanding of number patterns.

#### Input:

```
format :
```

The input consists of an integer n representing the specified row.

#### Output:

```
format :
```

The output displays the specified row of Pascal's Triangle, separated by a space (row starts from 1).

For negative input, print "Invalid Input".

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.
