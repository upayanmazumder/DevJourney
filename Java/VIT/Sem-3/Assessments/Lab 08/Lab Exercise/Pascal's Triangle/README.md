Single File Programming Question

Problem Statement


Sophia is curious about patterns in mathematics and discovers Pascal's Triangle during her studies. To explore its structure, she decides to write a program that generates any specific row. She creates a Java class named PascalTriangle to handle the logic of generating a row. 


By using the concept of binomial coefficients, she calculates each value in the row accurately. Her program takes an input number n and prints the nth row of Pascal's Triangle. This helps Sophia visualize combinations and enhances her understanding of number patterns.
