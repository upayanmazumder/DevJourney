# Print even and odd numbers

## Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Alex is working on a number classification project. He needs to write a program that reads an array of integers, classifies them into even and odd numbers, and then prints the array elements.

Help Alex as he wants to use a class and objects to implement this program. The class should be named NumberClassifier.

#### Input:

```
format :
```

The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the number of elements in the array.

The second line consists of n space-separated integers, representing the array elements.

#### Output:

```
format :
```

The first line of output prints "Even numbers:".

The second line prints the even numbers from the given array, separated by a space.

The third line prints "Odd numbers:".

The fourth line prints the odd numbers from the given array, separated by a space.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

3 ≤ n ≤ 10

1 ≤ element ≤ 1000

There is at least one odd and one even digit in the input array given

Sample test cases :
#### Input 1:

```
5
9 2 11 4 8
Output 1 :
Even numbers:
2 4 8 
Odd numbers:
9 11 
Input 2 :
10
6 2 4 3 7 13 11 10 15 22
Output 2 :
Even numbers:
6 2 4 10 22 
Odd numbers:
3 7 13 11 15 
```
