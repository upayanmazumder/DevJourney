Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement:



Alice is studying mathematics, and she's interested in calculating the factorial of a number and finding the sum of the digits of the factorial. To help her with this, you create a Factorial class that can perform both tasks using classes and objects.

Input format :
The first line of input contains the integer 'n'.

Output format :
The first line of the output should print the factorial of 'n' and the second line should print the sum of its digits in the following format:

"Factorial of <n> is: <factorial>

Sum of its digits is: <sum>"



Refer to the sample output for format specifications

Code constraints :
