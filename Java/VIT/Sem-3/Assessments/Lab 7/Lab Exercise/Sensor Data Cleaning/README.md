Single File Programming Question Problem Statement ﻿Zara is cleaning sensor data and notices that the array often contains consecutive duplicate values, which she wants to remove while keeping only one occurrence. The order of values should be preserved and only duplicates that appear right after each other should be removed. She creates a class DuplicateRemover with a method removeConsecutiveDuplicates() that reads the array, processes it, and prints the cleaned result. Input format : The first line of input contains an integer n, representing the number of elements. The second line of input contains n space-separated integers. Output format : The output displays the processed array with no consecutive duplicates, printed on a single line (space-separated integers). Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications. Code constraints : The given testcases fall under the following constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 −104 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104 Sample test cases : Input 1 : 5 1 1 2 2 3 Output 1 : 1 2 3 Input 2 : 3 4 4 4 Output 2 : 4
