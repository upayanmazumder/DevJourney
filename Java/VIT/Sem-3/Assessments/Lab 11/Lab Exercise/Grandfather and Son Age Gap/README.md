Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Arun wants to calculate the age gap between the grandfather and the son and determine the father's age after 5 years. 



Your task is to assist him in developing a program using three classes: GrandFather, Father, and Son, where the GrandFather stores the grandfather's age, the Father extends GrandFather to include the father's age and calculates his age after 5 years, and Son extends Father to include the son's age and calculate the age difference between the grandfather and the son.

Input format :
The input consists of three integers representing the ages of the grandfather, father, and son, one per line.

Output format :
The first line of output prints "Grandfather and son's age gap:" followed by an integer representing the age gap between the grandfather and the son, ending with "years".

The second line prints "Father's Age:" followed by an integer representing the father's age after 5 years, ending with "years".



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
50 ≤ Grandfather's age ≤ 120

30 ≤ Father's age ≤ 90

1 ≤ Son's age ≤ 60
