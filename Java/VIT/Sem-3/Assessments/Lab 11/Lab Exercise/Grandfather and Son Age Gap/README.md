# Grandfather and Son Age Gap

## Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Arun wants to calculate the age gap between the grandfather and the son and determine the father's age after 5 years.

Your task is to assist him in developing a program using three classes: GrandFather, Father, and Son, where the GrandFather stores the grandfather's age, the Father extends GrandFather to include the father's age and calculates his age after 5 years, and Son extends Father to include the son's age and calculate the age difference between the grandfather and the son.

#### Input:

```
format :
```

The input consists of three integers representing the ages of the grandfather, father, and son, one per line.

#### Output:

```
format :
```

The first line of output prints "Grandfather and son's age gap:" followed by an integer representing the age gap between the grandfather and the son, ending with "years".

The second line prints "Father's Age:" followed by an integer representing the father's age after 5 years, ending with "years".

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
50 ≤ Grandfather's age ≤ 120

30 ≤ Father's age ≤ 90

1 ≤ Son's age ≤ 60

Sample test cases :
#### Input 1:

```
50
30
3
Output 1 :
Grandfather and son's age gap: 47 years
Father's Age: 35 years
Input 2 :

45
25
Output 2 :
Grandfather and son's age gap: 55 years
Father's Age: 50 years
Input 3 :
120
90
60
Output 3 :
Grandfather and son's age gap: 60 years
Father's Age: 95 years
```
