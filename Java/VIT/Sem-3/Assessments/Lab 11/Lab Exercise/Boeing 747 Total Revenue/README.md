Problem Statement



Teena is launching a new airline, Boeing747, and needs to calculate the total revenue generated from ticket sales based on the ticket cost and seat availability. Teena's airline offers two types of seats: regular and premium. The ticket cost and seat availability for both types of seats need to be considered for revenue calculation.



To help with this, Teena wants to implement a system using multilevel inheritance with three classes:

Airline: This class will have the ticket cost as an attribute.
Indigo: This class will extend Airline and add the seat availability attribute.
Boeing747: This class will extend Indigo and include a method to calculate the total revenue based on the ticket cost and seat availability.


Teena needs to calculate the total revenue using the formula:

Total Revenue = ticket cost * seat availability


Help Teena implement this system for calculating the revenue of her airline.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a double value, representing the flight's ticket cost.

The second line consists of an integer, representing seat availability.

Output format :
The first line of output prints "Ticket Cost: Rs. " followed by a double value representing the ticket cost rounded to one decimal place.

The second line of output prints "Seat Availability: X seats" where X is an integer value representing the seat availability.

The third line of output prints "Total Revenue: Rs. " followed by a double value representing the total revenue rounded to one decimal place.



Refer to the sample output for the exact text and format.
