Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Mr.Kapoor wants to create a program to calculate the volume of a Cuboid and a Cube using method overriding. 



Implements a base class Cuboid with attributes for length, width, and height. Include a method calculateVolume() that computes the volume of the cuboid. 



Extends the base class with a subclass Cube representing a cube, where all sides are equal. Override the calculateVolume() method in the Cube class to compute the volume of the cube. 



The program should take user input for the dimensions of the cuboid and the side length of the cube and display the calculated volumes with two decimal places.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of 3 space-separated double values, representing the cuboid length, width, and height, respectively.

The second line consists of a double value, representing the side length of the cube.

Output format :
The first line of output prints the volume of the cuboid, rounded off to two decimal places.

The second line prints the volume of the cube, rounded off to two decimal places.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The test cases will fall under the following constraints:

1.00 ≤ length, width, height ≤ 60.00

1.00 ≤ side ≤ 50.00

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
60.0 60.0 60.0
50.0
Output 1 :
Volume of Cuboid: 216000.00
Volume of Cube: 125000.00
Input 2 :
1.0 1.0 1.0
1.0
Output 2 :
Volume of Cuboid: 1.00
Volume of Cube: 1.00
Input 3 :
12.1 13.4 17.6
23.7
Output 3 :
Volume of Cuboid: 2853.66
Volume of Cube: 13312.05
