Single File Programming Question

Problem Statement


Sesha is developing a weather monitoring system for a region with multiple weather stations. Each weather station collects temperature data hourly and stores it in a 2D array. 


Write a program that can add the temperature data from two different weather stations to create a combined temperature record for the region. 

Input format :

The first line of input consists of two space-separated integers N and M, representing the number of rows and columns of the matrices, respectively.

The next N lines consist of M space-separated integers, representing the values of the first matrix.

The following N lines consist of M space-separated integers, representing the values of the second matrix.

Output format :

The output prints the addition of the two matrices in N rows and M columns, representing the combined temperature record.


Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :

1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10

Sample test cases :

Input 1 :

3 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3

Output 1 :

2 3 4 6 7 8 10 11 12 

Input 2 :

1 3 25 5 5 5 44 5

Output 2 :

30 49 10
