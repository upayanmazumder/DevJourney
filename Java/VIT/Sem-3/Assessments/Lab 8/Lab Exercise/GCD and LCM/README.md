Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Alex is learning about the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) in mathematics. He decided to create a GCD class to find the GCD and LCM of two numbers. Write a program to find GCD and LCM using classes and objects.

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer 'a' representing the first number.

The second line of input contains an integer 'b' representing the second number.

Output format :
The first line of output prints "GCD: " followed by an integer representing the gcd of two numbers.

The second line of output prints "LCM: " followed by an integer representing the lcm of two numbers.
