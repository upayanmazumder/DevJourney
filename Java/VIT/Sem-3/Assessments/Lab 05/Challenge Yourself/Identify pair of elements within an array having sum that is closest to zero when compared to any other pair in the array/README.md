# Identify pair of elements within an array having sum that is closest to zero when compared to any other pair in the array

## Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Imagine you have an array of integer values, and you're tasked with identifying a pair of elements within the array. This pair of elements should have a sum that is the closest to zero when compared to any other pair in the array.

Your goal is to create a program that solves this problem efficiently. The program should accept an array of integers and return the pair of elements whose sum is closest to zero.

#### Input:

```
format :
```

The first line of the input is an integer N representing the size of the array.

The second line of the input contains N space-separated integer values.

#### Output:

```
format :
```

The output is displayed in the following format:

"Pair with the sum closest to zero: {value} and {value}"

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given testcases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 100

-1000 ≤ array elements ≤ 1000

elements displayed based on the input order.

Sample test cases :
#### Input 1:

```
5
9 10 -3 -5 -2
Output 1 :
Pair with the sum closest to zero: 9 and -5
Input 2 :
4
2 -7 1 6
Output 2 :
Pair with the sum closest to zero: -7 and 6
```
