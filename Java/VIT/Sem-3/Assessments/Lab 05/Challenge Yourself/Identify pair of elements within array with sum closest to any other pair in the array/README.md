Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement:
Imagine you have an array of integer values, and you're tasked with identifying a pair of elements within the array. This pair of elements should have a sum that is the closest to zero when compared to any other pair in the array.
Your goal is to create a program that solves this problem efficiently. The program should accept an array of integers and return the pair of elements whose sum is closest to zero.
Input format :
The first line of the input is an integer N representing the size of the array.
The second line of the input contains N space-separated integer values.
Output format :
The output is displayed in the following format:
"Pair with the sum closest to zero: {value} and {value}"
Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.
Code constraints :
The given testcases fall under the following constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
-1000 ≤ array elements ≤ 1000
elements displayed based on the input order.
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5 9 10 -3 -5 -2
Output 1 :
Pair with the sum closest to zero: 9 and -5
Input 2 :
4 2 -7 1 6
Output 2 :
Pair with the sum closest to zero: -7 and 6
