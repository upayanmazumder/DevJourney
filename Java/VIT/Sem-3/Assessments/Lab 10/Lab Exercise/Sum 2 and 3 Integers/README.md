Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Hari is working on a Java program for his homework to calculate the sum of two and three integers. Write a program that allows Hari to input two integers and three integers separately. Use overloaded methods called sum to calculate and display the sum for each case.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of two space-separated integers m and n.

The second line consists of three space-separated integers a, b, and c.

Output format :
The first line of output prints "Sum of two integers: " followed by the sum of m and n.

The second line prints "Sum of three integers: " followed by the sum of a, b, and c.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ input integers ≤ 1000
