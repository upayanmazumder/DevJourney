## Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Ella is managing her expenses and wants to calculate her item prices without applying any tax. She enters a array of item prices, which are written into a file named prices.txt.The program then reads these prices from prices.txt, writes them as they are to a new file named tax.txt, and displays the same prices in the console, without applying any tax. The final output will match the input prices exactly, be displayed on the console, and be saved in tax.txt.

#### Input:
