Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Roshni is tasked with developing a program for concatenating two arrays provided by the user. To accomplish this, she wants to create a class named ArrayConcatenator. The class includes a constructor to concatenate the elements of the input arrays. She wants to print the elements of the resulting array.



Help Roshni complete the program.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of elements of the first array.

The second line consists of N space-separated integers representing the first array elements.

The third line consists of an integer M, representing the number of elements of the second array.

The fourth line consists of M space-separated integers, representing the second array elements.

Output format :
The output prints the concatenated array of elements separated by a space.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints

1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10

1 ≤ array elements ≤ 100
