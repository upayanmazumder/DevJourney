Problem Statement



You have been tasked with creating a class, NumberSwapper, that allows for swapping two integer numbers. However, there's a special condition: if the two numbers are identical, there's no need to swap them, and this condition should be indicated.



Implement a Class NumberSwapper and a constructor public NumberSwapper(int num1, int num2) to swap two numbers.

Input format :
The first line of the input contains an integer num1 representing the first number.

The second line contains an integer num2 representing the second number.

Output format :
The output is displayed in the following format:

If num1 is equal to num2, the program prints: "Numbers are identical and need not be swapped"

If num1 is not equal to num2, the program prints: "Numbers after swapping: Number1={newNum1}, Number2={newNum2}"



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

-100 ≤ num1 ≤ 1000

-100 ≤ num2 ≤ 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
10
10
Output 1 :
Numbers are identical and need not be swapped
Input 2 :
5
7
Output 2 :
Numbers after swapping: Number1=7, Number2=5
Input 3 :
0
15
Output 3 :
Numbers after swapping: Number1=15, Number2=0
