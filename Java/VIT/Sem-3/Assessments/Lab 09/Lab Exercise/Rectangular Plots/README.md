# Rectangular Plots

## Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

One day, a creative architect received an unusual request from a client. The client needed a software program to calculate the area of rectangle-shaped garden plots. The client had the idea of using rectangular plots with various widths and heights to create unique gardens.

Write a program using a class Rectangle and a constructor to calculate the area of the rectangle.

Formula:

area of the rectangle = width * height

#### Input:

```
format :
```

The input consists of two space-separated double values, representing the width and height, respectively.

#### Output:

```
format :
```

The output prints the area of the rectangle, rounded off to two decimal places.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1.0 ≤ width, height ≤ 100.0

Sample test cases :
#### Input 1:

```
4.4 5.3
Output 1 :
23.32
Input 2 :
12.5 9.8
Output 2 :
122.50
```
