Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement
Rosh is intrigued by numerical patterns. Today, she stumbled upon a puzzle while working with arrays. She wants to compute the sum of the third-largest and second-smallest elements from a list of integers. She seeks your help to implement a program that solves this for her efficiently.
Input format :
The first line of input is an integer N, representing the size of the array.
The second line of input consists of N space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.
Output format :
The output displays a single integer representing the sum of the third-largest and second-smallest elements in the array.
Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.
Code constraints :
The given testcases fall under the following constraints:
3 ≤ N ≤ 50
1 ≤ elements ≤ 100
