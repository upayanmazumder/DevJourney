# Generic Class Capable of Sorting an Array of Double Data Type

## Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Rithesh is developing a generic class for sorting arrays of various types. He wants to create a program with a generic class capable of sorting an array of double data type. The program should provide functionality for sorting the array in increasing order.

Assist Rithesh in developing the program.

#### Input:

```
format :
```

The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of double values.

The second line consists of N space-separated double values.

#### Output:

```
format :
```

The output will be a single line displaying the sorted array of doubles in ascending order, formatted as an array string and printed in a square bracket separated by a comma and a space.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 10

0.00 ≤ double values ≤ 10.00

Sample test cases :
#### Input 1:

```
3
1.39 4.57 0.78
Output 1 :
[0.78, 1.39, 4.57]
Input 2 :
7
0.36 0.82 0.27 0.49 0.41 0.17 0.39
Output 2 :
[0.17, 0.27, 0.36, 0.39, 0.41, 0.49, 0.82]
```
