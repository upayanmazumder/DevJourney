# Replace Multiple of 3 with Fizz, of 5 with Buzz, and of both with FizzBuzz

## Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Helen wants to implement a FizzBuzz program using a generic class named FizzBuzz that takes a number of any numeric type.

FizzBuzz is a popular programming problem where you need to print numbers from 1 to a given number but replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".

Assist Helen in developing the program.

#### Input:

```
format :
```

The input consists of an integer N, representing the ending range for which FizzBuzz should be applied.

#### Output:

```
format :
```

The program prints the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to N in each line.

For each number, it should follow these rules:

If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
Otherwise, print the number itself.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 50
