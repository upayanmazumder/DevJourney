Single File Programming Question Problem Statement Mehul is working on optimizing sensor data for hardware processing. He needs to rearrange an array so that all the 0s are pushed to the end, while keeping the order of non-zero elements unchanged. He writes a class ZeroPusher with a method moveZerosToEnd() that reads an array, processes it using array-based logic, and prints the rearranged result with zeros shifted to the end. Input format : The first line of input contains an integer n, representing the number of elements. The second line of input contains n space-separated integers. Output format : The output displays the modified array, with all zeros at the end and the order of non-zero values maintained. Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications. Code constraints : The given testcases fall under the following constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 105 −104 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104 Sample test cases : Input 1 : 5 0 1 2 0 3 Output 1 : 1 2 3 0 0 Input 2 : 4 0 0 0 1 Output 2 : 1 0 0 0
