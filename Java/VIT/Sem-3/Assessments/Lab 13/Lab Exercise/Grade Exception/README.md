Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



You are tasked to create a program that defines a custom exception GradeException. The program should include a Student class with fields for the student's name, age, and grade. Implement a method in the Student class that checks the grade, and if the grade is below 40, it should throw a GradeException. Otherwise, it should display the student's details.

Input format :
The input consists of three parameters in separate lines:

A string representing the student's name.
An integer representing the student's age.
An integer representing the student's grade.
Output format :
The output will display the student's details if the grade is valid.

If the grade is below 40, the program will display an error message "Grade is below 40".



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ age ≤ 100

0 ≤ grade ≤ 100

The name is a non-empty string.
