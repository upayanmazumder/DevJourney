Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Anu is developing a program that represents a book and ensures the validity of its attributes upon creation. The program should handle exceptions for invalid book details and provide informative error messages.



Implement a Book class with the following attributes: title (String), author (String), publicationYear (int).
Create a constructor for the Book class that initializes the book's attributes (title, author, publication year).
Implement private validation methods (validateTitle, validateAuthor, validatePublicationYear) to ensure that the title is not empty, the author is not empty, and the publication year is a positive integer.
Throw IllegalArgumentException with appropriate error messages if validation fails.
Implement a method addBook in the Book class that prints "Book added successfully" to the console.


Help Anu to design the program.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a string, representing the title of the book.

The second line consists of a string, representing the author of the book.

If the book is added, print "Book added successfully"

If the title is an empty string, print "Invalid title: Title should not be empty"

If the author is an empty string, print "Invalid author: Author should not be empty"
