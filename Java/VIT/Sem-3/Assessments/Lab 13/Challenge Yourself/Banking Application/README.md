Problem Statement



Jamie is developing a banking application that manages loan repayments and account balances with specific rules and constraints. The application must ensure proper validation and handle various custom exceptions related to loan repayments:



Loan Overdue: If the loan is overdue by more than 60 days, throw LoanOverdueException with the message:

"Loan is overdue by more than 60 days. Immediate payment required."



Negative Repayment Amount: If the loan repayment amount is negative, throw NegativeLoanRepaymentAmountException with the message:

"Loan repayment amount cannot be negative."



Insufficient Funds: If the remaining balance after withdrawal is less than the minimum loan repayment amount, throw InsufficientFundsForLoanRepaymentException with the message:

"Insufficient funds to cover loan repayment after withdrawal."



The logic used for the withdrawal is:



Step 1: remainingBalance = balance − amount

Step 2: If remainingBalance < minLoanRepayment, throw exception.

Step 3: Else, update:



balance = balance − amount − minLoanRepayment

loanAmount = loanAmount − minLoanRepayment

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a double value b, representing the initial balance of the bank account.

The second line consists of a double value o, representing the outstanding loan amount.

The third line consists of a double value m, representing the minimum loan repayment amount.

The fourth line consists of an integer n, representing the number of days the loan is overdue.

The fifth line consists of a double value w, representing the amount to withdraw from the bank account.

Output format :
Successful Withdrawal and Repayment:

The first line of output prints: "Remaining Balance: " followed by the balance (rounded to two decimal places)

The second line of output prints: "Remaining Loan Amount: " followed by loanAmount (rounded to two decimal places)



Loan Overdue by More Than 60 Days:

The only line of output prints: "Loan is overdue by more than 60 days. Immediate payment required."



Negative Withdrawal Amount:

The only line of output prints: "Loan repayment amount cannot be negative."



Insufficient Funds for Loan Repayment After Withdrawal:

The only line of output prints: "Insufficient funds to cover loan repayment after withdrawal."



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.
