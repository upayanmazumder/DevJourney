# Palindrome Checker

## Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Julia is building a text analysis tool and needs to verify if a given string is a palindrome, ignoring case sensitivity.

Help Julia by writing a program that takes a string as input and checks if it reads the same forwards and backward, using java.lang.StringBuilder for string manipulation.

#### Input:

```
format :
```

The input consists of a string.

#### Output:

```
format :
```

The output prints the original string followed by whether it "is a palindrome" or "is not a palindrome".

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

The maximum length of the string is 50.

The string contains spaces, lowercase and uppercase letters.

The string is case-insensitive.

Sample test cases :
#### Input 1:

```
madam
Output 1 :
madam is a palindrome
Input 2 :
cat
Output 2 :
cat is not a palindrome
```
