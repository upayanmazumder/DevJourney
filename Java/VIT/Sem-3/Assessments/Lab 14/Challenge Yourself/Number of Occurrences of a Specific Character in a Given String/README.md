Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Sophie has been tasked with creating a program using the java.util.Scanner package that counts the number of occurrences of a specific character in a given string. The program should prompt the user to enter a string and then a single character. It should then compute how many times that character appears in the string and display the result.



Your task is to help Sophie in implementing the same.

Input format :
The first line of input contains a string S.

The second line contains a character C.

Output format :
The output prints a single line indicating the number of times the character C appears in the string S in the format: "The character 'C' occurs X times."



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ length of string ≤ 100

The string S will contain only printable ASCII characters, including spaces.

characters are case-sensitive.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
apple
p
Output 1 :
The character 'p' occurs 2 times.
Input 2 :
OpenAI is creating artificial intelligence
a
Output 2 :
The character 'a' occurs 3 times.
