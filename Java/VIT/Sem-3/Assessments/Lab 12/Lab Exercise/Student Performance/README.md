# Student Performance

## Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Alice, a teacher seeking efficiency in analyzing student performance, has enlisted your help to create a program. Your task is to implement the StudentMarksCalculator class, extending the abstract class MarksCalculator.

This abstract class has three methods: calculateSum (int) for total marks, calculateAverage (double) for average marks, and findBestMark (double) for the highest mark. Your job is to complete the implementation of these methods in the StudentMarksCalculator class.

#### Input:

```
format :
```

The first line of input is an integer representing the student ID.

The second line of input is an integer representing the number of subjects.

The third line of input is a space-separated integer representing the marks obtained by the student in each subject.

#### Output:

```
format :
```

The first line of output prints "Total Marks: " followed by an integer representing the sum of the marks.

The second line of output prints "Average Marks: " followed by a double value (rounded to two decimal places) representing the average marks.

The third line of output prints "Best Mark: " followed by an integer representing the highest mark obtained.

Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 15

1 ≤ Id ≤ 1000

1 ≤ marks ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
#### Input 1:

```
101
3
90 85 88
Output 1 :
Total Marks: 263
Average Marks: 87.67
Best Mark: 90
Input 2 :
102
2
100 80
Output 2 :
Total Marks: 180
Average Marks: 90.00
Best Mark: 100
Note :
The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
Marks : 10
Negative Marks : 0
