Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Develop a vehicle rental system that calculates the rental cost for different types of vehicles: Car, Bike, and Truck. Each vehicle type has its own rental rate. The system should be able to calculate the total rental cost based on the type of vehicle selected and the number of rental days.



To implement this system, create the following classes:



Vehicle: An abstract class that provides the structure for different types of vehicles. It contains attributes for the rental rate and abstract methods calculateRentalCost(int days) for calculating the rental cost.

Car: A concrete subclass of Vehicle that represents a car. It implements the rental cost calculation specific to cars.
Bike: A concrete subclass of Vehicle that represents a bike. It implements the rental cost calculation specific to bikes.
Truck: A concrete subclass of Vehicle that represents a truck. It implements the rental cost calculation specific to trucks.


Your system will allow users to input the rental rates for each type of vehicle and the number of rental days. Then, it will display the rental rate for the selected vehicle type and calculate and display the total rental cost based on the rental rate and the number of rental days.

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer, carRate, representing the rental rate for a car.

The second line contains an integer, bikeRate, representing the rental rate for a bike.

The third line contains an integer, truckRate, representing the rental rate for a truck.

The fourth line contains an integer, rentalDays, representing the number of days for rental.

Output format :
For each type of vehicle, the program should display two lines:

The first line should include "Rental Rate: rate per day," where rate is the rental rate for the vehicle.

The second line should include "Total Rental Cost for Vehicle Type: totalCost," where Vehicle Type is the type of vehicle (Car, Bike, or Truck), and totalCost is the total rental cost based on the rental rate and the number of days.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.
