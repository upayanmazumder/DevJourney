# Write a program that implements the basic operations of a queue

- [] Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
- [] Dequeue: Remove and return the element at the front of the queue.
- [] Display: Show the current elements in the queue.

The program should display a menu with the following options:

1. Enqueue
2. Dequeue
3. Display
4. Exit

The queue should handle overflow and underflow conditions appropriately
