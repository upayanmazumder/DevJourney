Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Caroline loves exploring the world of complex numbers and needs your help to perform addition operations. She wants to use a union named ComplexNumber to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.



Write a program to help Caroline perform complex number addition.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of two space-separated double values, representing the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number.

The second line consists of two space-separated double values, representing the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number.

Output format :
The output prints the sum of the complex numbers, rounded off to two decimal places.



Refer to the sample outputs for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

-150.0 ≤ first complex number ≤ 150.0

-150.0 ≤ second complex number ≤ 150.0

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
4.0 5.0
3.0 5.0
Output 1 :
7.00 + 10.00i
Input 2 :
-2.5 3.0
1.5 -2.0
Output 2 :
-1.00 + 1.00i
Input 3 :
125.0 35.0
75.0 150.0
Output 3 :
200.00 + 185.00i
