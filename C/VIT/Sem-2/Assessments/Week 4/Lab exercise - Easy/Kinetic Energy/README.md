# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Zoya is a physics enthusiast who loves experimenting with her mini toy cars. She is curious about understanding the kinetic energy of her toy cars based on their mass and velocity.

Help Zoya Create a macro named KINETIC_ENERGY to calculate the kinetic energy.

Formula: Kinetic Energy = 0.5 x mass x velocity2﻿

### Input format :

The first line of input consists of a double value, representing the mass of Zoya's toy car.

The second line consists of a double value, representing the velocity of Zoya's toy car.

### Output format :

The output prints a double value, representing the calculated kinetic energy in Joules, rounded off to two decimal places.

Refer to the sample outputs for formatting specifications.

### Code constraints :

In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1.0 ≤ mass ≤ 500.0

1.0 ≤ velocity ≤ 50.0

### Sample test cases :

#### Input 1 :

10.5
5.3

#### Output 1 :

147.47 Joules

#### Input 2 :

213.5
32.6

#### Output 2 :

113449.63 Joules
