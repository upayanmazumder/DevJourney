# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Philip needs a program that reads 10 integers from the user and checks if all the integers are the same. If they are not the same, the program should sort the integers in ascending order and display the sorted array. If all integers are the same, it should simply indicate this.

Help Philip by writing a program to achieve this functionality.

### Input format :

The input consists of an array of 10 integers separated by space.

### Output format :
