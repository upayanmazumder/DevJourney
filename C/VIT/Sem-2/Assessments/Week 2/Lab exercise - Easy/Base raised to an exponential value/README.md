# Single File Programming Question
## Problem Statement



Design a program to input a numeric base and exponent, efficiently calculate and display the result of the base raised to the given exponent. Use a function called calculatePower() that calculates and outputs the result.

### Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer b, representing the base value.

The second line consists of an integer e, representing the exponent value.

### Output format :
The output prints an integer representing the result of the base raised to the exponent value.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

### Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ b ≤ 20

1 ≤ e ≤ 5

### Sample test cases :
