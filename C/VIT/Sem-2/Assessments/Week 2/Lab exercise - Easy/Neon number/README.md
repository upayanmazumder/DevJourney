# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Misha wants to check and print whether the given number N is a neon number or not. Write a program that uses a function and helps her to complete this task.

A neon number is a number where the sum of digits of the square of the number is equal to the number.

Function Prototype: int neon(int)

Example 1

Input:

9

Output:

9 is a neon number

Explanation:

92 = 81, and the sum of its digits (8+1) is equal to the original number (9).

Example 2

Input:

12

Output:

12 is not a neon number

Explanation:

(12)2=144, and the sum of its digits (1+4+4) is not equal to the original number (12).

### Input format :

The input consists of an integer, N.

### Output format :

If N is a neon number, print "N is a neon number"

Otherwise, print "N is not a neon number"

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

### Code constraints :

In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

0 ≤ N ≤ 100

### Sample test cases :

#### Input 1 :

9

#### Output 1 :

9 is a neon number

#### Input 2 :
