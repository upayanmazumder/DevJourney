# Single File Programming Question
## Problem Statement



Aishu is working on an array manipulation project and needs to find the maximum and minimum elements in an array of integers. Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and finds the maximum and minimum elements in it.

### Input format :
The first line consists of an integer n, representing the array size.

The second line input consists of n space-separated integers, representing the array elements.

### Output format :
The first line displays "Maximum element is: " followed by the maximum element of the array.

The second line displays "Minimum element is: " followed by the minimum element of the array.



﻿Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

### Code constraints :
2 ≤ n ≤ 20

-1000 ≤ elements ≤ 1000

### Sample test cases :
#### Input 1 :
7
-34 -57 40 -41 133 77 81
#### Output 1 :
Maximum element is: 133
Minimum element is: -57
#### Input 2 :
3
-2 0 -7
#### Output 2 :
Maximum element is: 0
Minimum element is: -7
#### Input 3 :
4
99 99 99 99
#### Output 3 :
Maximum element is: 99
Minimum element is: 99
