# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Manoj wants to explore numbers. The number should be even and also a multiple of 10. Write a program to obtain a number x and check if it is even or not. If even, check whether it is a multiple of 10 or not.

Function Specifications:

void iseven(int x) - Prints whether the input number is even or not.
void ismultiple(int x) - Prints whether the input number is a multiple of 10 or not.

### Input format :

The input consists of an integer x.

### Output format :

The first line displays "Even" if x is even or "Not even" otherwise.

If x is even, the second line displays "Multiple of 10" if x is a multiple of 10 or "Not a multiple of 10" otherwise.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

### Code constraints :

In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ x ≤ 106

### Sample test cases :

#### Input 1 :

50

#### Output 1 :

Even
Multiple of 10

#### Input 2 :

13

#### Output 2 :

Not even

#### Input 3 :

1

#### Output 3 :

Not even

#### Input 4 :

1456

#### Output 4 :

Even
Not a multiple of 10
