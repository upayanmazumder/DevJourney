# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Sandeep is organizing a neighbourhood bicycle race and he wants to rearrange the starting positions of the participants.

Write a program that takes an array of participant numbers and an integer M and rotates the array to the right by M positions to determine the new starting order for the race.

### Input format :

The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of participants.

The second line consists of N space-separated integers, representing the participant numbers.

The third line consists of an integer M, representing the number of positions to be rotated.

### Output format :

The output prints the rotated array with M positions to the right, separated by a space.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

### Code constraints :

1 ≤ N ≤ 10

1 ≤ elements ≤ 100

1 ≤ M < N

### Sample test cases :

#### Input 1 :

5
47 56 95 24 38
3

#### Output 1 :

95 24 38 47 56

#### Input 2 :

8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
6

#### Output 2 :

3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2
