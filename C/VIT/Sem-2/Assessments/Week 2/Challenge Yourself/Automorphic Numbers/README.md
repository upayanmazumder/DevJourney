# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Sheela and Balu are discussing automorphic numbers, a special type where the square of a number ends with the same digits as the original number. Balu is tasked with creating a program to determine if a given number is automorphic using the function isAutomorphic().

Help him achieve this.

### Input format :

The input consists of an integer n, representing the number that Balu needs to check for being an automorphic number.

### Output format :

If n is an automorphic number, the output prints "The number is an automorphic."

If n is not an automorphic number, the output prints "The number is NOT an automorphic."

Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

### Code constraints :

In the given scenario, the test cases will fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 100

### Sample test cases :

#### Input 1 :

5

#### Output 1 :

The number is an automorphic.

#### Input 2 :

7

#### Output 2 :

The number is NOT an automorphic.

#### Input 3 :

1

#### Output 3 :

The number is an automorphic.

#### Input 4 :

100

#### Output 4 :

The number is NOT an automorphic.
