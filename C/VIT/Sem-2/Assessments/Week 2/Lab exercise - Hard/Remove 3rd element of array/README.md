Problem Statement

Teju considers the number 3 unlucky and wishes to remove the element located at the 3rd position in an array, considering the first position in the array as position 1. 

Write a program that eliminates the element at this 3rd position and then displays the modified array.

Input format :
The first line consists of an integer n, the size of the array.

The second line consists of n space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.

Output format :
After removing the element at the 3rd position, the output displays space-separated integer array values.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases will fall under the following constraints:

3 ≤ n ≤ 15
