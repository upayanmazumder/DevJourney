Problem Statement﻿



Jack is curious about duck numbers, which are defined as numbers containing at least one '0' but do not start with '0'. Write a recursive function that checks if a given integer is a duck number.



Function Specifications: bool isDuckNumber(int)

Input format :
The input consists of an integer, n.

Output format :
Print "n is a duck number." if it is a duck number.

Print "n is not a duck number." if it is not a duck number.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 105

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
102
Output 1 :
102 is a duck number.
Input 2 :
033
Output 2 :
33 is not a duck number.
Input 3 :
10030
Output 3 :
10030 is a duck number.
