# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Ria is a mathematician who loves exploring combinatorics. She is working on a project that involves calculating permutations.

Ria wants to create a program that takes the values of n and r as input and calculates the permutations of n elements taken r at a time.

Write a program using pointers and a function calculatePermutations that, given the values of n and r, calculates and prints the permutations of n elements taken r at a time.

Permutation: n! / (n - r)!

### Input format :

The first line consists of an integer n, representing the total number of elements.

The second line consists of an integer r, representing the number of elements to be taken at a time.

### Output format :

The output prints the result of the permutation.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

### Code constraints :

In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 20

1 ≤ r ≤ 10

### Sample test cases :

#### Input 1 :

4
3

#### Output 1 :

#### Input 2 :

8
5

#### Output 2 :

6720

#### Input 3 :
