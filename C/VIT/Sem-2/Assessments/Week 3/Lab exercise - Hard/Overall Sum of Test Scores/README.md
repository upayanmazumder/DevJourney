Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



In a classroom, students provide their test scores one by one. Write a program that takes the number of students and their test scores as input, calculates the total score using a pointer, and prints the overall sum of the test scores. 



Use an array and a pointer to navigate through the scores efficiently.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of students.

The second line consists of N space-separated integers, representing the scores of N students.

Output format :
The output prints an integer representing the sum of the scores of N students.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10

10 ≤ score ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1
56
Output 1 :
56
Input 2 :
6
12 24 35 46 89 94
Output 2 :
