# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Ginny, an aspiring mathematician, is exploring the wonders of right-angled triangles and their hypotenuses.

She wishes to create a program that takes the lengths of two sides of a right-angled triangle as input and calculates the length of the hypotenuse.

Write a program using pointers and a function calculateHypotenuse, given the lengths of two sides, calculates and prints the length of the hypotenuse.

Hypotenuse: √(a2 + b2) where a and b represent side 1 and side 2 respectively.

### Input format :

The first line of input consists of a double value, representing the length of side 1.

The second line consists of a double value, representing the length of side 2.

### Output format :

The output prints a double value, representing the length of the hypotenuse, rounded off to two decimal places.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

### Code constraints :

In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1.0 ≤ side 1 ≤ 75.0

1.0 ≤ side 2 ≤ 75.0

### Sample test cases :

#### Input 1 :

3.5
4.2

#### Output 1 :

5.47

#### Input 2 :

17.5
24.8

#### Output 2 :

30.35

#### Input 3 :

73.5
68.0

#### Output 3 :

100.13
