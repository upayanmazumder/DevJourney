# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Meet Professor Henry, a brilliant mathematician who loves solving brain teasers. One day, he stumbles upon an intriguing problem - finding the sum of the diagonals in a 3D matrix. He decides to write a program to solve it using pointers and multi-dimensional concepts but realizes that the task is more challenging than he thought.

Therefore, assist him in writing a program that calculates the sum of the diagonals in a 3D matrix.

### Input format :

The first line of the input consists of three space-separated integers: rows, columns, and height representing the dimensions of the 3D matrix.

The next lines of the input consist of integers representing the elements of the 3D matrix.

### Output format :

The output displays a single integer representing the sum of the main diagonal elements in the 3D matrix if the matrix is a cubic matrix.

Otherwise, the output displays a message as "Error" and terminates.

Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

### Code constraints :

1 ≤ rows, columns, height ≤ 5

1 ≤ Elements in the matrix ≤ 1000
