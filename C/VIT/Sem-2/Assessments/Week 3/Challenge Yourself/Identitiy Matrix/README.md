# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

In a mathematics class, students are learning about identity matrices and their properties. To reinforce their understanding, they are tasked with developing a program that checks whether a given matrix is an identity matrix or not using pointers.

Write a program to assist the students.

### Input format :

The first line of input consists of two integers, n and m representing the order of the matrix.

The following lines consist of the matrix elements.

### Output format :

The output prints whether the given matrix is an identity matrix or not.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

### Code constraints :

1 ≤ m, n ≤ 10

### Sample test cases :

#### Input 1 :

3 3
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1

#### Output 1 :

Identity matrix

#### Input 2 :

3 3
1 0 0
1 0 1
0 1 0

#### Output 2 :

Not an identity matrix
