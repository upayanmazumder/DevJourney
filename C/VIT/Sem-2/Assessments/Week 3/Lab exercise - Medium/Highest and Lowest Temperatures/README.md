Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Connie is monitoring temperature data and needs a program to find the highest and lowest temperatures in an array. Write a program that takes user-input temperatures, identifies the maximum and minimum values, and prints them.



Ensure the program showcases the use of pointers in accessing array elements.

Input format :
The first line consists of an integer n, representing the number of elements in the array.

The second line consists of n integers representing the temperature values.

Output format :
The first line displays "Highest temperatures: " followed by the highest temperature.

The second line displays "Lowest temperatures: " followed by the lowest temperature.



Refer to the sample outputs for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 20

In this scenario, the temperature values are assumed to be in the range of 1 to 1000.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3 
20 12 19
Output 1 :
Highest temperatures: 20
Lowest temperatures: 12
Input 2 :
5
6 25 12 21 24 
Output 2 :
Highest temperatures: 25
Lowest temperatures: 6
