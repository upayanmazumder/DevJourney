# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Becky is analyzing a list of integers. She needs to find the maximum absolute difference between the two elements in the list.

Write a program that takes an integer n as input, followed by n integers, and outputs the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in the list using pointers.

### Input format :

The first line contains an integer n, representing the number of elements in the list.

The second line contains n integers separated by spaces, representing the elements in the list.

### Output format :

The output prints a single integer representing the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in the list.

### Code constraints :

3 ≤ n ≤ 20

### Sample test cases :

#### Input 1 :

3
7 9 10

#### Output 1 :

3

#### Input 2 :

5
10 9 15 12 8
