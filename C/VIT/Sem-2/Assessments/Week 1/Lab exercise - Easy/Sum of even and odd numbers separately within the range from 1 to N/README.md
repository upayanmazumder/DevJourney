# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Wilson needs to develop a program that calculates the sum of even and odd numbers separately within the range from 1 to N. Using looping and continue statements, the program iterates through each number and accumulates the sums.

Finally, it displays the sums of even and odd numbers. Write a program to help Wilson achieve the same.

### Input format

The input consists of a positive integer N.

### Output format

The first line of output prints "Sum of even numbers: " followed by the sum of even numbers from 1 to N.

The second line prints "Sum of odd numbers: " followed by the sum of odd numbers from 1 to N.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

### Code constraints

In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 200

### Sample test cases

#### Input 1

```
1
```

#### Output 1

```
Sum of even numbers: 0
Sum of odd numbers: 1
```

#### Input 2

```
10
```

#### Output 2

```
Sum of even numbers: 30
Sum of odd numbers: 25
```
