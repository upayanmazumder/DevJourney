# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Claire, a software developer, is tasked with designing a program to calculate the sum of all numbers less than a given limit that are multiples of either of two specified numbers.

She requires a program wherein she can input three integers: N representing the limit, M representing one multiple, and P representing another multiple. Upon execution, the program should output the sum of these multiples within the given limit for Claire's analysis.

## Input Format

The input consists of three space-separated integers: 
- An integer N representing the limit
- An integer M representing one of the multiples
- An integer P representing another multiple

## Output Format

The output displays an integer which is the calculated sum.

Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

## Code Constraints

In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:
- \(10 \leq N \leq 1000\)
- \(2 \leq M, P \leq 10\)

## Sample Test Cases

**Input 1:**
```
10 2 3
```

**Output 1:**
```
32
```

**Input 2:**
```
156 2 5
```

**Output 2:**
```
7286
```
