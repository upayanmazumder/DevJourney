# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Claire, a software developer, is tasked with designing a program to calculate the sum of all numbers less than a given limit that are multiples of either of two specified numbers.

She requires a program wherein she can input three integers: N representing the limit, M representing one multiple, and P representing another multiple. Upon execution, the program should output the sum of these multiples within the given limit for Claire's analysis.

## Input Format

The input consists of three space-separated integers:

- An integer N representing the limit
- An integer M representing one of the multiples
- An integer P representing another multiple

## Output Format

The output displays an integer which is the calculated sum.

Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

## Code Constraints

In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

- (10 \\leq N \\leq 1000)
- (2 \\leq M, P \\leq 10)

## Sample Test Cases

**Input 1:**

```
10 2 3
```

**Output 1:**

```
32
```

**Input 2:**

```
156 2 5
```

**Output 2:**

```
7286
```
