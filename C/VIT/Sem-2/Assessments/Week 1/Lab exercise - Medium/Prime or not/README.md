# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Imagine you are a curious explorer named Alex, delving into the world of programming. Eager to grasp the concept of prime numbers, you embark on a coding adventure.

Your goal is to write a program that takes a number as input and reveals whether it is a prime number or not.

**Note:** Use nested if-else statement.

### Input format

The input consists of a single integer `n`, representing the number to be checked for primality.

### Output format

If the input number is a prime number, the output displays `n is a prime number.` where `n` is the input number.

If the input number is not a prime number, the output displays `n is not a prime number.` where `n` is the input number.

Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

### Code constraints

In the given scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

- (2 \\leq n \\leq 103)

### Sample test cases

**Input 1:**

```
5
```

**Output 1:**

```
5 is a prime number.
```

**Input 2:**

```
1000
```

**Output 2:**

```
1000 is not a prime number.
```

**Input 3:**

```
2
```

**Output 3:**

```
2 is a prime number.
```

### Whitelist

**Set 1:**

- `if`

**Set 2:**
