# Single File Programming Question

## Problem Statement

Antony is tasked with developing a program that takes an integer input and performs different operations based on whether the number is odd or even.

- If the input number is odd, the program should reverse it.
- If it's even, it should calculate the sum of its digits.

The program should utilize the `goto` statement for control flow.

### Input Format

The input consists of a positive integer N.

### Output Format

- If N is odd, the output prints "Reversed number: " followed by the reversed number of N.
- If N is even, the output prints "Sum of digits: " followed by the sum of the digits of N.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

### Code Constraints

In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

- \(11 \leq N \leq 200\)

### Sample Test Cases

**Input 1:**
```
12
```
**Output 1:**
```
Sum of digits: 3
```

**Input 2:**
```
13
```
**Output 2:**
```
Reversed number: 31
```
